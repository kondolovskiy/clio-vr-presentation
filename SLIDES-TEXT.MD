First of all we wanna say thanks for everybody for your votes. we are very pleased.

So, let us start. Here is our agenda. And before the demo we wanna describe what is VR, why we used VR in web and after the demo we are going to talk a bit about opportunities that this technology opens for us.

There is simple explanation from Wikipedia. I guess everyone heard about it and we won’t spent a lot of time here. If you still don’t know what is it I just can recommend you find the VR glasses and try it :) Continue

But why we decided to get web based technology? Because we are web developers and we all know how to work with it. Also we know how to support it and how to implement it, if it is needed. And, the main point - it works in browser, and we can say it works everywhere.

Before we started development we did some investigation about technologies that provides us develop all this cool things. So, there is no a lot instruments and we tried this three. To make long story short: Three.js is assembler for 3d in web, but it’s very hard to use especially for VR apps. React360 is a wrapper on three.js. It provides us more flexibility during development, but it still to hard to using and also it has the problem with performance. And A-frame is declarative wrapper on three.js that’s provides us to create powerful vr applications use just HTML in general. This framework was created spacial for VR and supports a lot of VR vendors.

And if we are talking about possibility of using we see it 
in creation different education applications, for example it could
be biology, chemistry, Physics and even History.
Also we can use it for different skill training, distance learning
and many others ways that is just limited of out imagination.
